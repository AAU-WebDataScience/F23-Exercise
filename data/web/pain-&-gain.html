Pain & Gain is a 2013 American action comedy film directed by Michael Bay and starring <a href="https://smallweb-f22.netlify.app/mark-wahlberg.html">Mark Wahlberg</a>, Dwayne Johnson, and <a href="https://smallweb-f22.netlify.app/anthony-mackie.html">Anthony Mackie</a>. It is based on the activities of Sun Gym gang, a group of ex-convicts and bodybuilders convicted of kidnapping, extortion, torture, and murder in Miami in the mid-1990s. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's screenplay is adapted from a 1999 series of Miami New Times articles by Pete Collins, which were compiled in the book Pain & Gain: This Is a True Story, released concurrently with the film. The film's title is a play on a common adage frequently used in fitness: "No pain, no gain". 
On February 13, 2012, it was confirmed that the budget for the film would be funded by <a href="https://smallweb-f22.netlify.app/paramount.html">Paramount</a> Pictures as part of a two-picture deal with Bay, and the budget would be $35 million, making it the cheapest film he has ever directed.
