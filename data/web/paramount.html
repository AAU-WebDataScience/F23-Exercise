            Paramount Pictures Corporation is an American film and television production and distribution company and a subsidiary of ViacomCBS. 
            It is the fifth oldest film studio in the world, the second oldest film studio in the United States (behind Universal Pictures), and the sole member

            The film was released in select North American theaters on December 17, 2010, and in the United Kingdom on February 4, 2011. 
            The Fighter grossed $129 million worldwide and received largely positive reviews, with critics praising the performances of Wahlberg, Adams, Bale, and Leo, with many comments about the former's weight, accent, and mannerisms. 
            It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, winning the awards for Best Supporting Actor (Bale) and Best Supporting Actress (Leo). 
            It was the first film to win both awards since Hannah and Her Sisters in 1986.
