        <p>The <span property="s:name">Academy Award for Best Picture</span> is one of the Academy Awards presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture 
            Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) since the awards debuted in 1929. This award goes to the producers of the film and is 
            the only category in which every member of the Oscars is eligible to submit a nomination and vote on the final ballot. 
            The Best Picture category is often the final award of the night and is widely considered as the most prestigious 
            honor of the ceremony. The Grand Staircase columns at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the Academy Awards 
            ceremonies have been held since 2002, showcase every film that has won the Best Picture title since the award's 
            inception. There have been 581 films nominated for Best Picture and 94 winners.</p>
