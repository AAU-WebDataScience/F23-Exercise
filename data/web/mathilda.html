        <p>Matilda is a 1996 American fantasy comedy film co-produced and directed by Danny DeVito from a screenplay by 
            Nicholas Kazan and Robin Swicord, based on the 1988 novel of the same name by Roald Dahl. The film stars Mara 
            Wilson as the title character with DeVito (who also served a dual role as the narrator), Rhea Perlman, Embeth 
            Davidtz, and Pam Ferris in supporting roles. The plot centers on the titular child prodigy who develops 
            psychokinetic abilities and uses them to deal with her disreputable family and the tyrannical principal 
            of her school.

            Matilda was released in the United States on August 2, 1996, by <a href="sony-pictures-entertainment-inc.html">Sony Pictures</a> Releasing. The film received 
            positive reviews from critics, with praise being directed towards its faithfulness to the novel and DeVito's 
            direction. However, the film was commercially unsuccessful, grossing $33.5 million in the United States on a 
            $36 million budget.</p>
