        Alicia Christian "Jodie" Foster (born November 19, 1962) is an American actress, director, and producer.[1][2] Regarded as one of the best actresses of her generation,[3] she is the recipient of numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards, three British Academy Film Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and the honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award. For her work as a director, she has been nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. People magazine named her the most beautiful woman in the world in 1992,[4] and in 2003, she was voted Number 23 in Channel 4's countdown of the 100 Greatest Movie Stars of All Time.[5] Entertainment Weekly named her 57th on their list of 100 Greatest Movie Stars of All Time in 1996.[6] In 2016, she was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star located at 6927 Hollywood Boulevard.[7]
        
        Foster began her professional career as a child model when she was three years old, and made her acting debut in 1968 in the television sitcom Mayberry R.F.D. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she worked in several television series and made her film debut with Disney's Napoleon and Samantha (1972). Following appearances in the musical Tom Sawyer (1973) and Martin Scorsese's comedy-drama Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974), her breakthrough came with Scorsese's psychological thriller <a href="https://smallweb-f22.netlify.app/taxi-driver.html"> Taxi Driver</a> (1976), where she played a child prostitute, and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her other roles as a teenager include the musical Bugsy Malone (1976) and the thriller The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane (1976), and she became a popular teen idol by starring in Disney's Freaky Friday (1976) and Candleshoe (1977), as well as Carny (1980) and Foxes (1980).
        
        Foster experienced career setbacks in the early 2000s, including the cancellation of a film project and the closing down of her production company, but she then starred in four commercially successful thrillers: Panic Room (2002), Flightplan (2005), Inside Man (2006), and The Brave One (2007). She has concentrated on directing in the 2010s, with the films The Beaver (2011) and Money Monster (2016),[8] and episodes for 
        <a href="https://smallweb-f22.netlify.app/Netflix.html"> Netflix</a> television series Orange Is the New Black, House of Cards, and Black Mirror.
        
        Foster's mother was concerned that her daughter's career would end by the time she grew out of playing children, and decided that Foster should also begin acting in films for adult audiences.[30] After the minor supporting role in Alice, Scorsese cast her in the role of a child prostitute in Taxi Driver (1976).[31] To be able to do the film, Foster had to undergo psychiatric assessment and was accompanied by a social worker on set.[32][33][34] Her older sister acted as her stand-in in sexually suggestive scenes.[33][35] Foster later commented on the role, saying that she hated "the idea that everybody thinks if a kid's going to be an actress it means that she has to play Shirley Temple or someone's little sister."[36] During the filming, Foster developed a bond with co-star <a href="https://smallweb-f22.netlify.app/robert-deniro.html"> Robert Deniro</a>, who saw "serious potential" in her and dedicated time rehearsing scenes with her.
