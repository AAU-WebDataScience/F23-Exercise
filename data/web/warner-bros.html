        Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (commonly known as Warner Bros.[a] and abbreviated as WB) is an American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered at the Warner Bros. 
        Studios complex in Burbank, California, and a subsidiary of AT&T's WarnerMedia through its Studios & Networks division. Founded in 1923 by four brothers Harry, Albert (Abe), Sam, and Jack Warner, the company 
        established itself as a leader in the American film industry before diversifying into animation, television, and video games, and is one of the "Big Five" major American film studios, as well as a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).

The company is known for its film studio division, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which includes Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, the Warner Animation Group, 
Castle Rock Entertainment, and DC Films. Among its other assets include the television production company Warner Bros. Television Studios; animation studios Warner 
Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network Studios; comic book publisher DC Comics; video game development and publishing arm Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment; cable
 television channels Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Boomerang, and Turner Classic Movies; and a 50% interest in broadcast television network The CW, which is co-owned 
 with ViacomCBS. Warner Bros. also operates various divisions specializing in publishing, merchandising, music, theater, and theme parks.[6] Bugs Bunny, a cartoon 
 character created as part of the Looney Tunes series, is the company's official mascot. 

 As of 2015, Warner Bros. is one of only three studios to have released a pair of billion-dollar films in the same year (along with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures and 
 Universal Studios); the distinction was achieved in 2012 with <a property="wikiprop:P345" href="/the-dark-knight-rises.html">The Dark Knight Rises</a> and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.[201][202][203] As of 2016, it is the only studio to cross $1 billion at the domestic box office every year since 2000.[204]
