            It is both a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs and also loosely based on the real-life 
            Boston Winter Hill Gang; 
            the character Colin Sullivan is based on the corrupt FBI agent John Connolly, 
            while the character Frank Costello is based on Irish-American gangster  Whitey Bulger.

            Irish Mob boss Frank Costello (Nicholson) plants Colin Sullivan (Damon) as a spy within the Massachusetts State Police; 
            simultaneously, the police assign undercover state trooper Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) to infiltrate Costello's crew. 
            When both sides realize the situation, Sullivan and Costigan each attempt to discover the other's identity before 
            they are found out. The Departed was a critical and commercial success, and won several accolades,
