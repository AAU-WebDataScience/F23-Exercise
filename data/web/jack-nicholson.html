        John Joseph Nicholson (born April 22, 1937) is an American actor and
        filmmaker whose career has spanned more than 60 years. He is known for
        having played a wide range of starring and supporting roles, including
        comic characters, romantic leads, anti-heroes, and villains. In many of
        his films, he played the "eternal outsider, the sardonic drifter", someone
        who rebels against the social structure.

        Nicholson's 12 Academy Award nominations make him the most nominated male
