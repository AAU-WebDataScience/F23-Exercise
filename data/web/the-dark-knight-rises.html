        <p>The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 superhero film directed by <a href="christopher-nolan.html">Christopher Nolan</a>, 
            who co-wrote the screenplay with 
            his brother Jonathan Nolan, and the story with David S. Goyer. The film is based on the DC Comics character 
            Batman, it is the final installment in Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy, and the sequel to The Dark Knight (2008). 
            The film stars <a href="christian-bale.html">Christian Bale</a> as Bruce Wayne / Batman, alongside 
            <a href="michael-caine.html">Michael Caine</a>, 
            Gary Oldman, <a href="anne-hathaway.html">Anne Hathaway</a>, 
            Tom Hardy, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon Levitt, and Morgan Freeman. Eight years after the events of The Dark 
            Knight, the revolutionary Bane forces Bruce Wayne to resume his role as Batman and save Gotham City from nuclear 
            destruction. Christopher Nolan was hesitant about returning to the series for a third film, but agreed after 
            developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note. 
            Nolan drew inspiration from Bane's comic book debut in the 1993 "Knightfall" storyline, the 1986 series 
            The Dark Knight Returns, and the 1999 storyline "No Man's Land". Filming took place from May to November 2011 
            in locations including Jodhpur, London, Nottingham, Glasgow, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, and Pittsburgh. 
            Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras for much of the filming, including the first six minutes of the film, to 
            optimize the quality of the picture. A vehicle variation of the Batplane and Batcopter termed the "Bat", an 
            underground prison set, and a new Batcave set were created specifically for the film. As with The Dark Knight, 
            viral marketing campaigns began early during production. When filming concluded, 
            <a href="warner-bros--entertainment-inc.html">Warner Bros.</a> refocused its campaign, 
            developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film, screening theatrical trailers, and 
            sending out information regarding the film's plot. The Dark Knight Rises premiered in New York City on July 16, 2012. 
            The film was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012. The film received positive 
            reviews, with praise being directed toward the performances (particularly Hardy's), action sequences, direction, 
            screenplay, musical score, and emotional depth, with many critics deeming it a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. 
            The film grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the second film in the Batman film series to earn $1 billion, 
            and the highest grossing Batman film to date. In addition to being Nolan's highest-grossing film, it became the 
            seventh-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release, as well as the third-highest-grossing film of 
            2012. It was named one of the top 10 films of 2012 by the American Film Institute. It is considered one of the 
            greatest superhero films of all time, one of the best films of the 2010s, as well as one of the best films ever made.</p>
