        The Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 American biographical crime black comedy film directed by <a property="wdp:P57" href="/martin-scorsese.html">Martin Scorsese</a> and written by Terence Winter,
        based on the 2007 memoir by Jordan Belfort. It recounts Belfort's perspective on his career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm,
        Stratton Oakmont, engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on Wall Street, which ultimately led to his downfall. <a property="wdp:P161" href="/leonardo-dicaprio.html">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>,
        who was also a producer on the film, stars as Belfort, with Jonah Hill as his business partner and friend, Donnie Azoff, Margot Robbie as his wife,
        Naomi Lapaglia, and Kyle Chandler as FBI agent Patrick Denham, who tries to bring Belfort down.

        The film premiered in New York City on December 17, 2013, and was released in the United States on December 25, 2013,
        by Paramount Pictures, and was the first major American film to be released exclusively through digital distribution.
        It was a major commercial success, grossing $392 million worldwide during its theatrical run, becoming Scorsese's highest-grossing film.
        The film sparked controversy over its morally ambiguous depiction of events, lack of sympathy for victims, explicit sexual content, extreme profanity,
        depiction of hard drug use, and the use of animals during production. It set a Guinness World Record for the most instances of swearing in a film.

        The film received generally positive reviews from critics, along with some moral censure. It was nominated for several awards,
        including five at the 86th Academy Awards ceremony: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor (for DiCaprio)
        and Best Supporting Actor (for Hill). Leo won Best Actor – Musical or Comedy at the 71st Golden Globe Awards,
        where the film was also nominated for Best Picture – Musical or Comedy.
