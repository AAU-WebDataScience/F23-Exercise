        <p>The Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 American biographical 
            black comedy crime film directed by <a href = "martin-scorsese.html"> Martin Scorsese </a> and written by Terence Winter, 
            based on the 2007 memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort. It recounts Belfort's perspective 
            on his career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm, Stratton Oakmont, engaged in rampant
            corruption and fraud on Wall Street, which ultimately led to his downfall. 
            <a href="leonardo-dicaprio.html"> Leonardo DiCaprio </a>, who was also a 
            producer of the film, stars as Belfort, with Jonah Hill as his business partner and friend, Donnie Azoff, Margot Robbie 
            as his wife, Naomi Lapaglia, and Kyle Chandler as FBI agent Patrick Denham, who tries to take Belfort down. 
            Rights for Belfort's memoir were secured in 2007 by DiCaprio and Warner Bros. and with Scorsese set to direct, 
            but content restrictions stalled production. The project was later greenlit under an independent production house 
            Red Granite Pictures. Filming took place in late 2012 in New York City and was shot mostly on film stock. 
            The film premiered in New York City on December 17, 2013, and was released in the United States on December 25, 2013, 
            by Paramount Pictures, and was the first major American film to be released exclusively through digital distribution. 
            It was a major commercial success, grossing $392 million worldwide during its theatrical run, 
            becoming Scorsese's highest-grossing film. The film was controversial for morally ambiguous depiction of events and
            lack of sympathy for victims, as well as explicit sexual content, extreme profanity, 
            depiction of hard drug use, and the use of animals during production. 
            It set a Guinness World Record for the most instances of swearing in a film. The film's financing became
            implicated in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad corruption scandal, leading to Red Granite Pictures being 
            investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice and Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission. 
            The film received positive reviews from critics (along with some moral censure) and appeared in several 
            'best of the year' lists. It was nominated for several awards, including five at the 86th Academy Awards ceremony: 
            <a = href="academy-award-for-best-picture.html"> Best Picture </a>, 
            <a href = "academy-award-for-best-director.html">Best Director </a>, Best Adapted Screenplay, 
            Best Actor (for DiCaprio) and Best Supporting Actor (for Hill). 
            DiCaprio won Best Actor – Musical or Comedy at the 71st Golden Globe Awards, where the film was also nominated 
            for Best Picture – Musical or Comedy. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest films of the 2010s.</p>
