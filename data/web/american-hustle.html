    <p><span property="s:name">American Hustle</span> is a 2013 American black comedy crime film directed by David O. Russell. 
        It was written by Eric Warren Singer and Russell, inspired by the FBI Abscam operation of the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
        It stars <a rel="s:actor" href="christian-bale.html">Christian Bale</a> and <a rel="s:actor" href="amy-adams.html">Amy Adams</a> as two con artists who are forced by an FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) to set up an 
        elaborate sting operation on corrupt politicians, including the mayor of Camden, New Jersey (<a rel="s:actor" href="jeremy-renner.html">Jeremy Jenner</a>). 
        Jennifer Lawrence plays the unpredictable wife of Bale's character. 
        Principal photography took place from March to May 2013 in Boston and Worcester, Massachusetts as well as New York City. 
        American Hustle was released nationwide in the United States on December 13, 2013. 
        It opened to acclaim from critics, who praised its screenplay and ensemble cast. 
        The film received ten nominations at the 86th Academy Awards, 
        including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor (Bale), Best Actress (Adams), 
        Best Supporting Actor (Cooper), and Best Supporting Actress (Lawrence). 
        It received three BAFTA Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture â€“ Musical or Comedy, 
        and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. 
        The production was set up at <a rel="s:productionCompany" href="columbia-pictures-industries--inc.html">Columbia Pictures</a>, with Charles Roven and Richard Suckle producing through Atlas Entertainment, who initially considered Ben Affleck to direct, before David O.
