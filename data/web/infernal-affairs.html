        The film was selected as the Hong Kong entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 76th Academy Awards but was not nominated. Miramax Films acquired the United States distribution rights and gave it a limited US theatrical release in 2004. Martin Scorsese remade the film in 2006 as <a property="wdp:P4969" href="/the-departed.html">The Departed</a>, which won the Academy Award for <a href="/best-picture-award.html">Best Picture</a> as well as Best Adapted Screenplay.
