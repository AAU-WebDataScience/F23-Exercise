     <p>Martin Charles Scorsese (/skɔːrˈsɛsi/;[2] Italian: [skorˈseːze, -se]; born November 17, 1942) is an
         American film director, producer, and screenwriter. He is the recipient of many accolades,
         including nine Academy Award nominations (and one win) for Best Director, four British Academy
         Film Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and two Directors Guild of America Awards. Five of his
         films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as
         "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant". </p>

           Scorsese's work during the 1980s decade saw mixed critical evaluation, but with the black
           comedy After Hours (1985), he won Best Director at Cannes. His 1990 gangster epic Goodfellas,
           starring De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci, once again brought critical acclaim to Scorsese
           and won him three British Academy Film Awards. After deviating from crime films to mixed
           results, he returned to the genre with Casino (1995). In the 2000s and 2010s decades,
           Scorsese garnered critical acclaim and box office success with a series of collaborations
           with Leonardo DiCaprio. <a property="wdp:P1476" href="/the-departed.html">The Departed</a> (2006) earned him his first Academy Award for Best
           Director, and their successive collaborations include the psychological thriller Shutter
           Island (2010) and the biopic <a property="wdp:P1476" href="/the-wolf-of-wall-street.html">The Wolf of Wall Street</a> (2013). Returning to his familiar
           territory of crime films, Scorsese collaborated with De Niro again on
           <a property="wdp:P1476" href="/the-irishman.html">The Irishman</a> (2019),
           which additionally starred Pesci and Al Pacino.
