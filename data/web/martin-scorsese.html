        <p><span property="s:name">Martin Charles Scorsese</span> (/skɔːrˈsɛsi/ skor-SESS-ee, Italian: [skorˈseːze, -eːse]; born November 17, 1942) is an American film director, producer, screenwriter and actor. 
            He is the recipient of many accolades, including an Academy Award, three Primetime Emmy Awards, a Grammy Award, four British Academy Film Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and two Directors Guild of America Awards. 
            Scorsese has received various honors including the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1997, the Kennedy Center Honor in 2007, and the BAFTA Fellowship in 2012. 
            Five of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant". 
            Scorsese received an MA from New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development in 1968. 
            His directorial debut, Who's That Knocking at My Door (1967), was accepted into the Chicago Film Festival. 
            In the 1970s and 1980s decades, Scorsese emerged as one of the major figures of the New Hollywood era. Scorsese's films, much influenced by his Italian-American background and upbringing in New York City, center on macho-posturing insecure men and explore crime, machismo, nihilism, and Catholic concepts of guilt and redemption. 
            His trademark styles include extensive use of slow motion and freeze frames, graphic depictions of extreme violence, and liberal use of profanity. 
            His 1973 crime film Mean Streets, dealing with machismo and violence, and exploring Catholic concepts of guilt and redemption, was a blueprint for his filmmaking styles. 
            Scorsese won the Palme d'Or at Cannes with his 1976 psychological thriller Taxi Driver, which starred Robert De Niro, who became associated with Scorsese through eight more films including New York, New York (1977), Raging Bull (1980) The King of Comedy (1982), Goodfellas (1990), and Casino (1995). 
            In the 2000s and 2010s decades, Scorsese garnered critical acclaim and box office success with a series of collaborations with Leonardo DiCaprio. 
            These films include Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004),  <a rev="s:director" href = "the-departed.html"> The Departed (2006) </a>, Shutter Island (2010) and <a rev="s:director" href = "the-wolf-of-wall-street.html">The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)</a>. 
            Returning to his familiar territory of crime films, Scorsese collaborated with De Niro again on <a rev="s:director" href = "the-irishman.html">The Irishman (2019)</a>. 
            Scorsese's other film work includes the black comedy After Hours (1985), the romantic drama The Age of Innocence (1993), the children's adventure drama Hugo (2011), and the religious epics The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Kundun (1997) and Silence (2016). In addition to film, Scorsese has directed episodes for some television series including Boardwalk Empire (2011–2015), and Vinyl (2016), and the documentaries Public Speaking (2010), and Pretend It's a City (2021). He is also known for several rock music documentaries including The Last Waltz (1978), No Direction Home (2005), Shine a Light (2008), and George Harrison: Living in the Material World (2011). 
            An advocate for film preservation and restoration, he founded three nonprofit organizations: the Film Foundation in 1990, the World Cinema Foundation in 2007, and the African Film Heritage Project in 2017.</p>
