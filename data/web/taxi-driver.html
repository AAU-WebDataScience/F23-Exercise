        <p>Taxi Driver is a 1976 American film directed by <a href="martin-scorsese.html">Martin Scorsese</a>, 
            written by Paul Schrader, and 
            starring <a href="robert-de-niro.html">Robert De Niro</a>, <a href="jodie-foster.html">Jodie Foster</a>, 
            Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Leonard Harris, 
            and Albert Brooks. Set in a decaying and morally bankrupt New York City following the Vietnam War, 
            the film follows Travis Bickle (De Niro), a veteran working as a <a href="taxi.html">taxi</a> driver, and his deteriorating 
            mental state as he works nights in the city. With The Wrong Man (1956) and A Bigger Splash (1973) as 
            inspiration, Scorsese wanted the film to feel like a dream to audiences. With cinematographer 
            Michael Chapman, filming began in the summer of 1975 in New York City, with actors taking pay cuts 
            to ensure that the project could be completed on a low budget of $1.9 million. Production concluded 
            that same year. Bernard Herrmann composed the film's music in what would be his final score, finished 
            just several hours before his death; the film is dedicated to him. The film was theatrically released 
            by <a href="columbia-pictures-industries--inc.html">Columbia Pictures</a> on February 7, 1976, where it 
            was a critical and commercial success, despite 
            generating controversy for its graphic violence at the climactic ending, and casting of then 
            12-year-old Foster in the role of a child prostitute. The film received numerous accolades including 
            the 1976 Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or, and four nominations at the 49th Academy Awards, including 
            for Best Picture, Best Actor (for De Niro), and Best Supporting Actress (for Foster). 
            Although Taxi Driver generated further controversy for its role in John Hinckley Jr.'s motive to attempt 
            to assassinate then-President Ronald Reagan, the film has remained popular; one of the most culturally 
            significant and inspirational of its time. In 2012, Sight & Sound named it the 31st-best film ever in 
            its decennial critics' poll, ranked with The Godfather Part II, and the fifth-greatest film of all time 
            on its directors' poll. In 1994, the film was considered "culturally, historically or aesthetically" 
            significant by the US Library of Congress, and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.</p>
