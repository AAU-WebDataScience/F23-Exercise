        Taxi Driver is a 1976 American film directed by Martin Scorsese, written by Paul Schrader, and starring <a rel="wikiitem:Q5" href="https://smallweb-f22.netlify.app/robert-deniro.html"> Robert Deniro </a>, <a rel="wikiitem:Q5" href="https://smallweb-f22.netlify.app/jodie-foster.html">Jodie Foster</a> , Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Leonard Harris, and Albert Brooks. Set in a decaying and morally bankrupt New York City following the Vietnam War, the film follows Travis Bickle (De Niro), a taxi driver and veteran, and his deteriorating mental state as he works nights in the city.

        The film was theatrically released by <a property="wdp:P272" href="https://smallweb-f22.netlify.app/columbia-pictures.html">Columbia Pictures</a> on February 8, 1976, where it was a critical and commercial success, despite generating controversy for its graphic violence at the climactic ending, and casting of then 12-year-old Foster in the role of a child prostitute.
