    <p>The <span property="s:name">Academy Award for Best Director</span> (officially known as the Academy Award of Merit for Directing) is an award presented 
        annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It is given in honor of a film director who has 
        exhibited outstanding directing while working in the film industry.The award is traditionally presented by the previous 
        year's Best Director winner. The 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929 with the award being split into "Dramatic" 
        and "Comedy" categories; Frank Borzage and Lewis Milestone won for 7th Heaven and Two Arabian Knights, respectively. 
        However, these categories were merged for all subsequent ceremonies. Nominees are determined by single transferable 
        vote within the directors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting 
        members of the Academy. For the first eleven years of the Academy Awards, directors were allowed to be nominated for 
        multiple films in the same year. However, after the nomination of Michael Curtiz for two films, Angels with Dirty Faces 
        and Four Daughters, at the 11th Academy Awards, the rules were revised so that an individual could only be nominated for 
        one film at each ceremony. That rule has since been amended, although the only director who has received multiple 
        nominations in the same year was Steven Soderbergh for Erin Brockovich and Traffic in 2000, winning the award for the 
        latter. The Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history. 
        Of the 88 films that won Best Picture and were also nominated for Best Director, 67 won the award. Since its inception, 
        the award has been given to 74 directors or directing teams. As of the 2021 ceremony, 
        <a href="new-zealand.html">New Zealand</a> filmmaker Jane Campion is the most recent winner in this category for her 
        work on The Power of the Dog and the third woman to win it.</p>
